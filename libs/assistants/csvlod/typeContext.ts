I am developing an application that generates Enterprise Architecture artifacts based on the CSVLOD framework. CSVLOD is a structured framework that organizes the development of Enterprise Architecture into six dimensions: **Considerations, Standards, Vision, Landscapes, Schemas, and Designs**. 

### Purpose of CSVLOD in Enterprise Architecture
CSVLOD provides a comprehensive approach to managing and designing the architecture of an organization by addressing the following key aspects:
1. **Strategic Alignment:** Ensures that all architectural efforts align with the strategic goals and vision of the organization.
2. **Scalability and Flexibility:** Facilitates the creation of architectures that can adapt to changing business environments and technological advances.
3. **Standardization:** Encourages the use of consistent standards and methodologies across projects, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
4. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Provides a common language and structure to involve various stakeholders, fostering collaboration and understanding.
5. **Risk Mitigation:** Identifies potential risks and constraints early in the process, enabling proactive decision-making.

### Benefits of Using CSVLOD
By leveraging CSVLOD, organizations can:
- **Optimize Decision-Making:** Clearly understand the impact of decisions across different dimensions of the architecture.
- **Enhance Communication:** Use structured and visualized artifacts to communicate complex ideas effectively across teams and stakeholders.
- **Improve Resource Allocation:** Focus resources on areas that deliver the most value, guided by the insights from each CSVLOD dimension.
- **Achieve Consistency:** Apply a unified framework that ensures coherence and interoperability across all architectural initiatives.

### Expected Artifacts
The application will generate artifacts for each dimension, capturing essential elements such as:
- **Considerations:** Key constraints, assumptions, and dependencies that influence architectural decisions.
- **Standards:** Agreed-upon guidelines and methodologies for implementation.
- **Vision:** Strategic objectives and desired outcomes driving the architecture.
- **Landscapes:** High-level representations of the current and future states of the architecture.
- **Schemas:** Detailed structural blueprints for specific architectural components.
- **Designs:** Concrete solutions and implementation plans.

Each artifact will provide a foundation for informed decision-making, enable better collaboration, and ensure alignment with the organizationâ€™s strategic goals.
